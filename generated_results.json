writing tool as doubt can be, in her hands it\u2019s a precision instrument.", "Like her contemporary Sarah Jarosz, Hull has joined the rarefied company of Nickel Creek expats Chris Thile, Sara

rare cases involving birth defects, everyone has chins.", "Sure, some people have less pronounced ones than others, perhaps because their lower jaws are small or they have more flesh around the area.", "But if you peeled back that flesh and exposed their jawbones \u2014 and maybe don\u2019t do that \u2014 you\u2019d still see a chin.\u201d \u2019So, why do chins exist?\u2019 \u201dThere are no firm answers, which isn\u2019t for lack of effort.", "Evolutionary biologists have been proposing hypotheses for more than a century, and Pampush has together with David Daegling. \u201cWe kept

bigger chins than women, and stronger chins are often equated with attractiveness.", "Perhaps the chin is a sexual ornament, the human equivalent of a stag\u2019s antlers or a peacock\u2019s tail, a way of attracting mates or perhaps even signaling one\u2019s health and quality. \u201cBut if that\u2019s the case, we\u2019d be the only mammal ever where both sexes have selected for the exact same ornament,\u201d says Pampush.\u201d \u201dIn other words, women have chins, too.", "Chin shape may well be relevant to sex, but that doesn\u2019t explain chin presence. \u201cThey must have been there for some other reason before we started looking at the shape of them. \u201d\u201d \u201dThen, there are hypotheses that \u201cstretch the concept of natural selection,\u201d says Pampush.", "For example, one idea says that chins are adaptations for deflecting punches to the face.", "That is, they helped early humans to take one on the chin. \u201cThat would require humans to hit each other so often, and to suffer such dire consequences from being hit without a chin . .. it\u2019s unrealistic,\u201d says Pampush.\u201d \u201dAlso, chins are terrible for deflecting blows.", "They don\u2019t disperse the incoming forces very evenly, which results in broken jaws.", "Even if our ancestors were constantly pummeling each other in the face, they would have fared better by reinforcing their jaws all the way round.\u201d \u201dPampush doubts that chins are adaptations at all.", "He thinks it\u2019s more likely that they are \u2014 incidental features that have no benefits in themselves, but are byproducts of evolution acting upon something else.\u201d \u201dFor example, during human evolution, our faces shortened and our posture straightened.", "These changes made our mouths more cramped.", "To give our tongues and soft tissues more room, and to avoid constricting our airways, the lower jaw developed a forward slope, of which the chin was a side effect.", "The problem with this idea is that the chin\u2019s outer face doesn\u2019t follow the contours of its inner face, and has an exceptionally thick knob of bone.", "None of that screams \u201c measure. \u201d\u201d \u2019\u2019 \u2019A different explanation portrays the chin as a bit of the jaw that got left behind while the rest shrunk back.", "As early humans started cooking and processing our food, we made fewer demands upon our teeth, which started shrinking as a result.", "They gradually retracted into the face, while the part of the lower jaw that held them did not .", "Hence: chin.\u2019 \u2019Stephen Jay Gould and Richard Lewontin, who coined the concept of evolutionary spandrels, liked this hypothesis.", "So does from the University of Iowa, who studies facial evolution. \u201cIt seems that the appearance of the chin itself is probably related to patterns of facial reduction in humans during the Pleistocene,\u201d he says. \u201cIn this sense, understanding why faces became smaller is important to explaining why we have chins. \u201d \u2019 \u201d\u201cBut why did the lower border of the jaw also not shrink?\u201d", "Pampush asks. \u201cWhat happened that left that last little bit sticking out?\u201d", "This is the problem with spandrel hypotheses more generally: They\u2019re often very hard to test.\u201d \u201dIt may seem frustrating to have so many imperfect competing hypotheses, but that\u2019s part of the joy of chins: They reveal something about how scientists think about evolution.", "Some see the sculpting power of natural selection in everything, and view chins as surely some kind of adaptation.\u201d \u2019Others see natural selection as just one of many evolutionary forces, and so gravitate towards a explanation. \u201cThe chin is one of these rare phenomena in evolutionary biology that really exposes the deep philosophical differences between researchers in the field,\u201d says Pampush.\u2019 \u201dAnd, indeed, between people outside the field. \u201cI always get entertaining emails from lay people trying to help me so let me thank you in advance for what I\u2019m about to receive,\u201d he tells me.\u201d \u201dBecause if
